# Help — Clarity

## A Place for Clarity
Clarity is a quiet space for daily noticing. It is built for a single end-of-day entry: a record of the habits you chose, the moments that arrived, and the reflections worth keeping. It is a tool for seeing what your days are made of, without judgment or urgency.

## Logging
Distinguish between intentional habits and unplanned moments to see the balance of discipline and surprise. Mark habits with a joy blossom, use custom steps for numeric counters, and set "Joy by default" in Manage for activities that always lift your mood.

## History & Insights
The heatmap blends habit completion (Dusk Blue) with emotional intensity (Warm Ember). Any day in your history can be opened and edited at any time. Tap any item in the list below the calendar to filter the view and find correlations in your life.

## Ownership & Archiving
Your data never leaves your device. Archive habits or moments to hide them from your daily form without losing their historical records. Use Settings to export backups, import data, or perform a factory reset to start fresh.

## Calma
Clarity follows the Calma system: warm tones, paper-like typography, and zero urgency. No streaks, no scores, no guilt. Both full entries and single lines of reflection are enough.
